The Task Management Application users can only be created by admin users. The admin user or the Project Managers will create a new project with details and references of the users. 
When creating a project, the admin or project managers must list all the employees that will handle the project's tasks. 
After the creation of the project, the regular employees are limited only to adding their work progress for the task of the project that they are assigned. They are also allowed to edit the data of the progress that they only submitted.
